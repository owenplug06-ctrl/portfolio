Exercise 1:
a. The most interesting lesson I learned from the Tufte reading was how he deals with some time series data that can fluctuate with season trends. In the graphic that he displays on page 38, he goes through how the market trends deviate in a seasonal pattern however, after aggregation you get a different story of the data.

b.
The image I chose is on page 49 [Copper Conductivity](images/hw6.png). I chose this graphic because i find it super interesting how much data is able to be shown with little ink, as well as I find it interesting how the trends of copper conductivity merge at a high enough temperature. The encoded features are the x-axis being mapped to the degree temperature in Kelvin and the y-axis is mapped to the level of conductivity. An element of the graphic that would be hard to implement is the different lines in the background that appear and disappear. Tufte is trying to show how the conductivity of the coppers end up almost coming exactly together at around 5*10^3 Kelvin.

Exercise 2:
One idea that I learned from the reading sections is how much the audience needs to be considered when making a graph. In my life I have often been surounded by those who understand different graphs extreamly well. However, if I was trying to present data to a group of people who have not had the same expirence then I would maybe need to piviot to a very common graph like a bar graph or line graph.

One part that affected how I designed the graph was by avoiding layering these two metrics as they are non able to be comparable on the same graph because of the major difference in y-values. This would hide many smaller changes between the two.
